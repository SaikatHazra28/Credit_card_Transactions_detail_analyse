# 📊 Credit Card Transactions SQL Analysis

## 🔥 Project Overview
This project analyzes **credit card transactions** using SQL queries to derive insights such as:
- Top 5 cities with highest spending  
- Month-wise spending trends by card type  
- Highest and lowest expense types in each city  
- Gender-wise spending contribution  
- Month-over-month growth analysis
- ## 🗂️ Files Included  
- **database.xlsx** → Contains raw transaction data (used to create the SQL table).  
- **questions.txt** → Contains all problem statements.  
- **queries.sql** → SQL solutions for each problem.

## 📌 SQL Table Structure
The dataset consists of the following columns:
- `transaction_id` (INT) - Unique transaction ID  
- `card_type` (VARCHAR) - Type of credit card (Silver, Gold, Platinum, etc.)  
- `exp_type` (VARCHAR) - Expense category (Food, Travel, Entertainment, etc.)  
- `amount` (BIGINT) - Transaction amount  
- `city` (VARCHAR) - City where the transaction happened  
- `gender` (VARCHAR) - Gender of the cardholder  
- `transaction_date` (DATE) - Date of the transaction

## 🚀 SQL Questions & Solutions

### **1️⃣ Top 5 Cities by Total Spend & % Contribution**
```sql
WITH A AS (
    SELECT city, SUM(amount) AS city_spend
    FROM credit_card_transcations 
    GROUP BY city
), 
B AS (
    SELECT SUM(amount) AS total_spend FROM credit_card_transcations
)
SELECT TOP 5 city, city_spend * 1.0 / total_spend * 100 AS percentage_contribution
FROM A, B
ORDER BY city_spend DESC;

## **2️⃣ Find the Highest Spending Month for Each Card Type**
### 📝 Problem Statement:
Write a query to find the **month with the highest spend** for each `card_type`, along with the total amount spent in that month.

### 💡 Solution:
```sql
WITH cte AS (
    SELECT  
        card_type, 
        YEAR(transaction_date) AS year, 
        MONTH(transaction_date) AS month,
        SUM(amount) AS amount_spent
    FROM credit_card_transcations
    GROUP BY card_type, YEAR(transaction_date), MONTH(transaction_date)
)
SELECT card_type, year, month, amount_spent 
FROM (
    SELECT *, 
           RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY card_type ORDER BY amount_spent DESC) AS rn
    FROM cte
) A
WHERE rn = 1;
